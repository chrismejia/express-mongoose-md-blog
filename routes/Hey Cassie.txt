Hey Cassie,

I hope you've been well.

I caught COVID towards the tail of the end of year and it's taken quite a while for me to fully recover and be able to work. I apologize for the delay that this has caused.

I have updated the site with the requested changes and have also reached to Dawn informing her about my situation and about the next steps for setting up your hosting on Netlify.

Once again, I apologize my recovery has been as lengthy as it is, and I will be working on this project over this weekend to get everything to where it needs to be.
