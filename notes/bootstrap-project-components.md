## The `container` [(docs)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/containers/)

> ## Containers
>
> Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.
>
> ## How they work
>
> Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

## `margin` [(docs)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/spacing/)

> ## Spacing
>
> Bootstrap includes a wide range of shorthand responsive margin, padding, and gap utility classes to modify an element’s appearance.
>
> ## Margin and padding
>
> Assign responsive-friendly margin or padding values to an element or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes. Includes support for individual properties, all properties, and vertical and horizontal properties. Classes are built from a default Sass map ranging from .25rem to 3rem.

## `button` [(docs)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/buttons/)

### How Bootstrap organizes forms

Bootstrap provides a number of form related classes to style form components.

- `.form-control` [(docs)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#form-controls): the special sauce; provides Bootstrap's styling to text form inputs; `<input>`, `<select>`,`<textarea>`, etc.
- `.form-group` [(docs)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#form-groups): allows for proper grouping of single form entry field's elements, like a `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and others.
- `.form-label`: provides spacing to its associated

Each `<input>` in our form
